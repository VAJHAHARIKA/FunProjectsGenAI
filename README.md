This repository is a collection of fun and minimal GenAI projects that I built while learning and exploring generative AI. 
Each project uses cutting-edge models like GPT-2 and beyond, and is designed to be lightweight, beginner-friendly, and under 50 lines of code, perfect for quick experiments and hands-on learning.
These projects reflect my journey into GenAI, showcasing how simple prompts and models can create creative and useful outputs.
